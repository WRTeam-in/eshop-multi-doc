## 1. Get Flutter Ready

### Download the Flutter SDK  
Head over to the official Flutter site and grab the **3.32.1 Stable** version:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Download Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)

### Unzip the SDK  
Extract the ZIP file to a location of your choice:  
- **Windows**: Example `C:\dev\flutter`  
- **macOS/Linux**: Example `~/development/flutter`

### Add Flutter to PATH  
So you can run `flutter` from anywhere in the terminal:

- **Windows**:  
  - Go to **System Properties > Environment Variables**  
  - Add `C:\dev\flutter\bin` to the `Path` variable under system variables

- **macOS/Linux**:  
  - Open your terminal config file (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`, etc.)  
  - Add:
    ```bash
    export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/development/flutter/bin"
    ```

### Check the Setup  
Run this command to verify:
```bash
flutter doctor
```

It will list what's ready and what needs fixing.

## 2. Install Java JDK

Java is required for Android development. Here's how to set it up.

### Download JDK

Get the version of the Java Development Kit from:
ðŸ‘‰ [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
Choose the right installer for your OS.

### Set Environment Variables

* **Windows**:

  * Create a new variable `JAVA_HOME` and set it to the JDK installation directory
  * Update `Path` to include `%JAVA_HOME%\bin`

* **macOS/Linux**:
  Add to your terminal profile file:

  ```bash
  export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
  export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
  ```

### Test Java Setup

Run:

```bash
java -version
```

You should see the installed version displayed.

## 3. Install an IDE

Choose an editor that supports Flutter and Dart.

### Android Studio

* Download from: [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* Install **Flutter** and **Dart** plugins via `Settings > Plugins`

### Visual Studio Code

* Download: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Go to Extensions â†’ Search and install:

  * Flutter
  * Dart

Use the one you're comfortable with â€” both work great with Flutter!

## 4. Launch Your First App

### Run the App

Navigate to your project folder in terminal, then run:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Device Setup

* **Android**: Use AVD Manager in Android Studio to set up an emulator
* **iOS (macOS only)**: Install Xcode and open the Simulator

### Final Verification

Use:

```bash
flutter doctor
```

to make sure all tools are properly configured.
