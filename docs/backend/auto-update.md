# Auto Update

### How to auto update your admin panel or web version to the latest version?

> **Note:**  
> If you are upgrading from a very old version, please update the system sequentially, one version after another. **Do not skip any versions in between.**

#### Steps:

1. Find the **update from vX.X to vX.X.X.zip** file in your downloaded PHP source code.
2. Visit: `http://eshop.com/admin/updater`
3. You will see simple instructions, current version to latest version information, and the **"Update The System"** button.
4. Upload the **update.zip** file.
5. Click on the Update button.
6. That's all! You have successfully updated your system from the older version to the newer one.
